# whatsapp_chat.txt_to_html
Convert exported Whatsapp _chat.txt to HTML css

You can upload an exported _chat.txt file, give the users name and the chat will be converted to HTML with css which looks like a real Whatsapp chat. Put the media files in files directory. There are some restrictions, due to the exported _text file, ie. comments directly with pictures are not exported, replies are not exported (the reply will, but not the copy of the original message)
